# hello-world
## Is this markup we're using?

## I think it is! ##

Either way, I fell into a #Deep# rabbit hole trying to decifer what language one of the engineers at work was writing code in my RSLogix controller with. Ended up wanting to download/use a github file, now i'm taking the github learning guide, downloaded a new desktop app onto my already over-worked work laptop, wasted a bunch of time playing around typing this and just overall, will probably not make it back to doing what I had originally set out to do before my kids get up and my day is redirected to the never-ending world of being a dad... I guess it's not a bad morning after all.
